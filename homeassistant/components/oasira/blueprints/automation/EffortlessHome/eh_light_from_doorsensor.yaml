  name: Turn On Light from Door Sensor
  description:
    Automatically actitvate a light with a door sensor attached to the
    door, activating a smart switch or light.  The light will turn off at the end
    of a timer, or when you close the door.  Logic is also implemented to turn off
    the light in the event it's manually turned on while the door is open or after
    the automation has already run.
